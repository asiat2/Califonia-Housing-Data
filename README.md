The data is based on California Census in 1990.
Project step
1.Data cleaning (missing data, outliers, data errors)
2.Basic stats (min, max, std, median, etc.) using boxplot
3.Correlation analysis (pair-wise and attribute combinations)
4.Train and cross validate different models and select the most promising one (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were tried in this tutorial)
