##The data is based on California Census in 1990

##Project step
Data cleaning (missing data, outliers, data errors)
Basic stats (min, max, std, median, etc.) using boxplot
Correlation analysis (pair-wise and attribute combinations)
Train and cross validate different models and select the most promising one (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were tried in this tutorial)
